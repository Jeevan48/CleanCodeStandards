Vehicle Inspection: Write a C++ program to inspect a vehicle's condition.
The program should take the following inputs:
• Tire Pressure (in pounds per square inch, psi)
• Oil Level (in liters)
• Brake Pad Thickness (in millimeters)
Use logical operators to check if the vehicle's condition is satisfactory.
If anyof the conditions are not met, display a warning message.
